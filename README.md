# weather_prediction_CNN

This is my MSc project and Imperial College London. Numerical Weather Prediction the technique currently used to make weather predictions. However, it is expensive. 
The Met Office in the United Kingdom spend Â£1.2 billion pounds on their latest supercomputer; the Cray XC40. I am using machine learning techniques to make weather 
predictions from historical data. The key difference between numerical weather prediction and machine learning is the machine learning model needs to be trained once only,
while the numerical weather model must run continously. This is expensive, both from a CapEx and long-term running costs perspective. The goal is to link weather station 
data to further improve the accuracy.
